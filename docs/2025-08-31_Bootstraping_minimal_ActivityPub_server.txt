> Hey, there! I have a new exploration for us: I want to create the simplest possible implementation of an ActivityPub server, capable of serving some blog 
  post from my personal website. Based on what I know, we basically need to create some specific HTTP endpoints that refer to an outbox where an actor (my 
  blog@nigini.me) can put some some activities on (i.e., a JSON file with a list of those activities.) Am I missing something?

● You're on the right track! For a minimal ActivityPub server, you need a few key components:

  Required endpoints:
  - /.well-known/webfinger - for actor discovery
  - /actor (or similar) - your actor profile (Person object)
  - /outbox - collection of your activities
  - /posts/{id} - individual post objects

  Key ActivityPub objects:
  - Actor (Person) with inbox, outbox, followers, following
  - Activities (Create, Update, etc.) that wrap your blog posts
  - Objects (Note/Article) for the actual content

  Missing pieces you'll need:
  - HTTP signatures for authenticated requests
  - Content negotiation (application/activity+json)
  - Proper JSON-LD context
  - Basic inbox endpoint (even if you don't process incoming activities)

  The outbox can indeed be a static JSON file initially, but you'll want proper Activity objects wrapping your blog posts, not just the posts themselves.

  Would you like me to help you implement this step by step?

> Yeah. Let's implement it using Python3 and Flask. Let's start by creating the main app with the minimal endpoints, initially serving static json files.

> why is the "id" for the first "Create" item reference to the unexistent "/activities/" endpoint?

● You're absolutely right! The id for the Create activity should be a valid, resolvable URL. Since we don't have an /activities/ endpoint, that ID is
  broken.

  We have a few options:

  1. Use the post URL as the activity ID - simpler approach
  2. Create an /activities/ endpoint - more proper ActivityPub structure
  3. Use a fragment identifier - like https://nigini.me/activitypub/outbox#create-1

  Which approach would you prefer? The simplest would be to just use the post URL itself as both the activity ID and object ID, or we could create the
  activities endpoint to serve individual Create activities.

> I am confused: Considering that the content is actually at the "url" from my website, what is the difference between the information we'd store and serve 
  from the "/posts" and the "/activities" endpoint? What are the ActivityPub requirements regarding these IDs?

● Great question! Let me clarify the ActivityPub object model:

  Activities vs Objects:
  - Activity (like Create) = the action that happened ("I published a post")
  - Object (like Article) = the thing being acted upon (the actual blog post content)

  Your confusion is valid because:

  1. /activitypub/posts/hello-world would serve the Article object (the blog post itself with content, title, etc.)
  2. /activitypub/activities/create-1 would serve the Create activity (metadata about when/how the post was published)

  ActivityPub requirements:
  - Every object MUST have a unique id that's a valid URL
  - The id SHOULD be dereferenceable (you can GET it to retrieve the object)
  - Activities and Objects are separate concepts with separate IDs

  Practical difference:
  // GET /activitypub/posts/hello-world (the Article object)
  {
    "type": "Article",
    "id": "https://nigini.me/activitypub/posts/hello-world",
    "name": "Hello World",
    "content": "...",
    "url": "https://nigini.me/blog/hello-world"
  }

  // GET /activitypub/activities/create-1 (the Create activity)
  {
    "type": "Create",
    "id": "https://nigini.me/activitypub/activities/create-1",
    "actor": "https://nigini.me/activitypub/actor",
    "object": "https://nigini.me/activitypub/posts/hello-world"
  }

  We could skip the /activities endpoint and just reference objects directly in the outbox for simplicity.

> This is clear now, thanks. Let's create the activities endpoint then, as this reflects the different concepts.

> Another clarification question: does the "content" here have to be the same then the one would find inside the "url"?

● No, the content doesn't have to be identical to what's at the url! They serve different purposes:

  content in ActivityPub object:
  - Formatted for ActivityPub consumption (HTML snippets, plaintext, markdown)
  - Often truncated or summarized
  - Structured for social media display
  - May include ActivityPub-specific formatting

  Content at url (your blog):
  - Full blog post with your website's styling/layout
  - Complete HTML page with navigation, comments, etc.
  - Optimized for web browsing experience
  - May have different formatting, embedded media, etc.

  Common patterns:
  1. Summary approach: content has excerpt, url has full post
  2. Format difference: content has HTML snippet, url has full webpage
  3. Same content, different presentation: content has the text, url has the same text but with website chrome

  For a blog, you might put a summary or the first paragraph in content, while url points to the complete blog post. This way ActivityPub clients can show
   a preview, and users can click through for the full experience.

> What about the "summary" then? is that required?

● No, summary is optional in ActivityPub! Here's how it works:

  summary field:
  - Optional property
  - Acts as a "content warning" or brief abstract
  - Often used for spoiler warnings, content warnings, or short descriptions
  - If present, some clients show it first, then hide the main content behind a "Show more" button

  Typical usage patterns:
  1. Content warnings: "summary": "Politics, mention of violence"
  2. Blog abstracts: "summary": "A guide to setting up ActivityPub"
  3. Spoiler warnings: "summary": "Movie review (spoilers)"
  4. Skip it entirely for simple posts

  For your blog posts, you could:
  - Use summary for the blog post's meta description/excerpt
  - Use it as a content warning if needed
  - Skip it entirely and just use content

  The content field is what actually gets displayed as the main post content, while summary is more like metadata that some clients use for previews or
  warnings.

  You can remove summary from your JSON if you don't need it!

> great! go ahead and create the post "hello-world".

  - Actor profile at /activitypub/actor
  - Outbox at /activitypub/outbox
  - Individual activities at /activitypub/activities/<id>
  - Individual posts at /activitypub/posts/<id>

  All endpoints properly handle ActivityPub content negotiation. You can run it with python3 app.py and test the endpoints!

> what is a good way to test this software?

● Here are several good ways to test your ActivityPub server:

  1. Basic HTTP testing with curl:
  # Test webfinger
  curl "http://localhost:5000/.well-known/webfinger?resource=acct:blog@nigini.me"

  # Test actor (with proper headers)
  curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" http://localhost:5000/activitypub/actor

  # Test outbox
  curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" http://localhost:5000/activitypub/outbox

  2. ActivityPub-specific testing:
  # Test content negotiation
  curl -H "Accept: application/ld+json; profile=\"https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\"" http://localhost:5000/activitypub/actor

  # Test individual post
  curl -H "Accept: application/activity+json" http://localhost:5000/activitypub/posts/hello-world

  3. Online validators:
  - https://activitypub.rocks/ - validator for ActivityPub objects
  - WebFinger validators

  4. Real fediverse testing:
  - Deploy to a public domain
  - Try following your actor from Mastodon/other fediverse apps
  - Use tools like fediverse-pasture for automated testing

  5. Python unit tests:
  Create a simple test file to verify JSON structure and HTTP responses.

  Which approach would you like to start with?

> I see there is a "activitypub/actor#main-key" in the actor endpoint... how is that used and are we ready to respond to that call?

● Good catch! The #main-key is a JSON-LD fragment identifier that references the public key within the actor document. It's used for HTTP Signatures -
  ActivityPub's authentication mechanism.

  How it works:
  1. Other servers fetch your actor document
  2. They extract the public key from the publicKey field
  3. They use it to verify HTTP signatures on requests you send

  Current status:
  - ✅ We declare the key exists at #main-key
  - ❌ We have placeholder text instead of real key
  - ❌ We don't handle fragment identifier requests
  - ❌ We can't sign outgoing requests (no private key)

  What we need:
  1. Generate a real RSA key pair
  2. Handle fragment requests - when someone GETs /activitypub/actor#main-key, return just the key
  3. Sign outgoing requests (for later when we want to federate)

  For now: Your server can receive and display activities, but can't authenticate with other servers. Most fediverse apps will still be able to fetch your
   public posts.

  Want me to add proper key generation and fragment handling?

> That makes sense, and no, let's not add the keys now. Thanks.

● Perfect! Your minimal ActivityPub server is ready to test without the signing complexity. You can start the server with python3 app.py and test the
  endpoints with curl or try federating once you deploy it publicly.

  The key infrastructure can be added later when you want full two-way federation capabilities.

> it looks like the ".well-known" endpoint is meant to serve more than one actor, or even other metadata for a certain domain...

● Exactly right! The .well-known/webfinger endpoint is a domain-level discovery service that can handle multiple actors and other resources.

  Current limitation:
  Our code only handles acct:blog@nigini.me and returns a 404 for anything else.

  Typical webfinger uses:
  - Multiple actors: acct:blog@nigini.me, acct:photos@nigini.me, acct:john@nigini.me
  - Other protocols: mailto:, https://, etc.
  - Service discovery for the entire domain

  Better implementation would:
  1. Parse the resource parameter properly
  2. Route to different actors based on username
  3. Handle other resource types (email, URLs, etc.)
  4. Return proper errors for unknown resources

  Example:
  @app.route('/.well-known/webfinger')
  def webfinger():
      resource = request.args.get('resource')
      if resource == 'acct:blog@nigini.me':
          return jsonify(load_json_file('webfinger-blog.json'))
      elif resource == 'acct:photos@nigini.me':
          return jsonify(load_json_file('webfinger-photos.json'))
      else:
          return jsonify({'error': 'Resource not found'}), 404

  Want to refactor it to handle multiple actors or keep it simple for now?

> is the "acct" namespace fully focused on ActivityPub actors?

● No! The acct: scheme is not ActivityPub-specific. It's a general URI scheme defined in RFC 7565 for identifying user accounts across different
  protocols.

  acct: is used by:
  - Email: acct:user@example.com
  - XMPP/Jabber: acct:user@jabber.org
  - ActivityPub/Fediverse: acct:user@mastodon.social
  - Matrix: acct:@user:matrix.org
  - Other federated protocols

  WebFinger itself is protocol-agnostic - it's a discovery mechanism that can point to:
  - ActivityPub actors (application/activity+json)
  - Email addresses (mailto:)
  - XMPP endpoints (xmpp:)
  - Web profiles (text/html)
  - OpenID Connect (application/jrd+json)

  The acct: URI just means: "This is a user account identifier in the format user@domain"

  WebFinger's links array then tells you what protocols/services that account supports. So acct:blog@nigini.me could theoretically link to your
  ActivityPub actor, your email, your XMPP chat, etc.

  The acct: scheme predates ActivityPub and is used across many federated systems!
